## I built this using:
* ### AJAX ( no fetch-API or jQuery, only normal xhr-request ) to take the users from api.github.com/users
* ### Canvas-API for the "animations" ( randomly generated squares/rectangles/circles in the login-section )
* ### *Cookies* to store user data
## Issues:
* ### After you complete adding or deleting a elements from your cart the other section doesn't work anymore. So let's say that you add elements to your cart, you will see them in the delete section, but the event-listeners for the image ( when you click on an image, the product whould light up with a red-like border ) won't work.
## This project has helped me understand cookies better, how to delete from a cookie, how to update it, how to read it and how to add to the cookie
