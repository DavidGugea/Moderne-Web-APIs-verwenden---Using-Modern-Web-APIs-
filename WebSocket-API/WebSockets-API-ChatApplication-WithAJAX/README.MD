# I made this application using:
* Node.js ( ws-packet ) for the web-socket server
* I used XAMPP 7.4.1-0 for the normal http/s server to make a get request to the github-users API ( source : https://api.github.com/users )
* I used AJAX ( xhr-request, pure ajax NO jquery and NO fetch-API, only pure, classic AJAX, xhr-request ) to take all the users from the API
* I used WebSockets to talk to the server from the client and vice-versa
* Source to the web-socket packet and documentation : https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws
